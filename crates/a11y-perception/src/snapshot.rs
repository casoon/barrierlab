//! AXTree snapshot with focus and context for the Accessibility-Journey-Layer.
//!
//! A single static AXTree is what the WCAG rule engine checks against. The
//! Journey-Layer instead works with *sequences* of snapshots taken before
//! and after interactions, so state transitions become visible.
//!
//! [`AXSnapshot::capture`] nimmt einen solchen Zeitpunkt auf; die Differenz
//! zweier Aufnahmen berechnet [`crate::AXTreeDiff`].
